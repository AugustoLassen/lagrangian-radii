# Lagrangian Radii Analysis

A Python class for calculating Lagrangian radii, as described in:

**Smith et al. (2025)**  
[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250613884S/abstract]  

This class is under development. If you intend to use it in your scientific project, I encourage you to drop me an email: augusto.lassen@inaf.it

## Features

- Angular slicing of astronomical images
- Lagrangian radii estimate for different stellar populations
- Inclination correction and deprojection
- Calculate the Size-Shape Difference (SSD)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AugustoLassen/lagrangian-analysis.git
cd lagrangian-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
